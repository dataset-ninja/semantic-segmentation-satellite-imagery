The **Semantic Segmentation Satellite Imagery** dataset was taken from the project for the Kaggle Competition organised by [CentraleSupelec Deep Learning course](https://sdi.metz.centralesupelec.fr/spip.php?article2). The training dataset consisted of 261 images taken by a small UAV in the area of Houston, Texas to assess the damages after Hurricane Harvey. Each pixel was segmented into one of 25 classes such as *property roof*, *trees / shrubs*, *road / highway*, *swimming pool*, *vehicle*, *flooded*, etc.
