**Semantic-segmentation-with-PyTorch-Satellite-Imagery** is a dataset for semantic segmentation and instance segmentation tasks. It is used in the air detection industry.

The dataset consists of 261 images with 2478 labeled objects belonging to 25 different classes including *Background*, *Grass*, *Trees / Shrubs*, and other: *Property Roof*, *Vehicle*, *Chimney*, *Secondary Structure*, *Swimming Pool*, *Power Lines & Cables*, *Window*, *Road/Highway*, *Flooded*, *Dense Vegetation / Forest*, *Street Light*, *Water Body*, *Garbage Bins*, *Trampoline*, *Satellite Antenna*, *Parking Area - Commercial*, *Solar Panels*, *Under Construction / In Progress Status*, *Boat*, *Sports Complex / Arena*, *Industrial Site*, and *Water Tank / Oil Tank*.

Images in the Semantic-segmentation-Satellite-Imagery dataset have pixel-level semantic segmentation annotations. Due to the nature of the semantic segmentation task, it can be automatically transformed into an object detection (bounding boxes for every object) task. All images are labeled (i.e. with annotations). There is 1 split in the dataset: *ds0* (261 images). The dataset was released in 2022.

Here is the visualized example grid with annotations:
