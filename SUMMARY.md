**Semantic Segmentation with PyTorch Satellite Imagery** is a dataset for a semantic segmentation task. It is used in the geospatial domain. Possible applications of the dataset could be in the search and rescue (SAR) and environmental industries. 

The dataset consists of 261 images with 2478 labeled objects belonging to 25 different classes including *Background*, *Grass*, *Trees / Shrubs*, and other: *Property Roof*, *Vehicle*, *Chimney*, *Secondary Structure*, *Swimming Pool*, *Power Lines & Cables*, *Window*, *Road/Highway*, *Flooded*, *Dense Vegetation / Forest*, *Street Light*, *Water Body*, *Garbage Bins*, *Trampoline*, *Satellite Antenna*, *Parking Area - Commercial*, *Solar Panels*, *Under Construction / In Progress Status*, *Boat*, *Sports Complex / Arena*, *Industrial Site*, and *Water Tank / Oil Tank*. There are no pre-defined <i>train/val/test</i> splits in the dataset. The dataset was released in 2022.

Here are the visualized examples for the classes:
